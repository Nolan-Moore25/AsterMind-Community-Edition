# How Do You Implement AsterMind?

AsterMind ELM is a flexible machine learning library that can be implemented in multiple ways depending on your needs, technical capabilities, and use case. This document explains the three primary implementation models: **SDK/Library**, **Standalone Applications**, and **Service Engagements**.

## Overview

AsterMind ELM is fundamentally an **SDK (Software Development Kit)** — a library that developers integrate into their applications. However, the implementation can take different forms:

- **SDK/Library**: Developers integrate AsterMind directly into their existing applications
- **Standalone App**: Complete applications built on top of AsterMind (examples and demos)
- **Service Engagement**: Professional services to help customers implement AsterMind in their applications

All three models use the same core library (`@astermind/astermind-elm`), but differ in who does the integration work and how the end product is delivered.

---

## Model 1: SDK/Library Implementation

### What It Is

AsterMind ELM is primarily distributed as an **open-source SDK/library** that developers install and integrate into their own applications. This is the most common implementation model.

### Distribution Methods

**1. NPM Package (Recommended)**
```bash
npm install @astermind/astermind-elm
# or
pnpm add @astermind/astermind-elm
# or
yarn add @astermind/astermind-elm
```

**2. CDN (Browser)**
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@astermind/astermind-elm/dist/astermind.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  const { ELM, KernelELM } = window.astermind;
</script>
```

**3. Direct Import (ESM)**
```javascript
import { ELM, KernelELM, OnlineELM, DeepELM } from '@astermind/astermind-elm';
```

### How It Works

1. **Installation**: Developers add the library to their project via npm, CDN, or bundler
2. **Integration**: Developers write code to use AsterMind's APIs in their application
3. **Customization**: Developers configure models, train on their data, and integrate predictions into their workflows
4. **Deployment**: The library is bundled with the application (browser or Node.js)

### Use Cases

- **Web Applications**: Add ML capabilities to existing web apps
- **Node.js Services**: Server-side ML processing
- **Browser Extensions**: On-device ML in browser extensions
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**: Offline-capable ML features
- **React/Vue/Angular Apps**: Framework-agnostic integration
- **Mobile Web Apps**: ML in mobile browsers

### Example Integration

```typescript
// In your application code
import { ELM } from '@astermind/astermind-elm';

// Create and train a model
const elm = new ELM({
  categories: ['positive', 'negative', 'neutral'],
  hiddenUnits: 128
});

// Train on your data
elm.trainFromData(trainingData, labels);

// Use in your application
function analyzeSentiment(text: string) {
  const result = elm.predict(text);
  return result;
}
```

### Advantages

- ✅ **Full Control**: Developers have complete control over implementation
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Can be customized for specific use cases
- ✅ **No Vendor Lock-in**: Open-source, MIT licensed
- ✅ **Cost-Effective**: No per-request fees or subscription costs
- ✅ **Privacy**: All processing happens on-device
- ✅ **Fast**: No network latency, instant predictions

### Requirements

- Development team with JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- Ability to integrate npm packages or CDN scripts
- Understanding of machine learning concepts (helpful but not required)

5. **ELM Explanation Demo**: Educational presentation about ELMs

### How It Works

1. **Pre-built Applications**: Complete applications with UI, data handling, and ML models
2. **Ready to Run**: Can be deployed immediately or customized
3. **Full Stack**: Includes frontend, models, and example data
4. **Templates**: Can be used as starting points for custom applications

### Use Cases

- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrate AsterMind capabilities quickly
- **End-User Products**: Deploy as-is for specific use cases
- **Learning Tools**: Educational applications showing ML in action
- **Templates**: Starting points for custom development

cd AsterMind-ELM

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run a specific demo
npm run dev:lang        # Language detection
npm run dev:autocomplete # Autocomplete
npm run dev:news        # News classification
```

### Advantages

- ✅ **Quick Start**: Get running immediately without development
- ✅ **Complete Solution**: Full applications, not just libraries

## Summary

**AsterMind ELM is fundamentally an SDK/library**, but it can be implemented in three ways:

1. **SDK/Library** (Most Common): Developers integrate AsterMind into their applications
2. **Standalone Applications**: Pre-built apps demonstrating AsterMind capabilities
3. **Service Engagement**: Professional services for custom implementation and support

The choice depends on your:
- Technical capabilities
- Time constraints
- Budget
- Requirements complexity
- Need for support

All three models use the same core library (`@astermind/astermind-elm`), ensuring consistency and allowing you to move between models as your needs evolve.
