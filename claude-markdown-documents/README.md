# Claude Markdown Documents

Planning and narrative artifacts for the AsterMind-Community repository. Three kinds of documents live here:

- **ADRs** (Architecture Decision Records) — *why* a decision was made, what alternatives were weighed, and the tradeoffs we accepted. Stored in [`ADRs/`](./ADRs/).
- **Implementation Plans** — *how* we execute a decision: phases, file lists, checklists, validation steps. Stored in [`implementation-plans/`](./implementation-plans/).
- **Research Notebooks** — lab-style narratives capturing *what we asked, what we found, what surprised us, and what we decided*. The story behind the commits. Stored in [`research-notebooks/`](./research-notebooks/).

> ADRs answer **"why?"**, plans answer **"how, in what order, and how do we know it worked?"**, notebooks answer **"what was the situation, and what did we learn?"**. Pair them: one ADR usually has one plan, and notebooks document the investigation that led to an ADR or the retrospective after execution.

## Current artifacts

| 0008 | [Shorten NB-005 research notebook](./ADRs/ADR-0008-shorten-nb-005-research-notebook.md) | [Plan 0008](./implementation-plans/IMPL-0008-shorten-nb-005-research-notebook.md) | Cut Appendix A duplication, drop Mermaid/ASCII renders, tighten prose — 1033 → ~440–501 lines |

### Research notebooks

| # | Title | Topic |
|---|-------|-------|

| [NB-004](./research-notebooks/NB-004-lesson-curriculum-design.md) | Lesson curriculum design and L00 refactor | Template scaffold + L00 refactor; curriculum status; the "L00 stays bespoke" decision |
| [NB-005](./research-notebooks/NB-005-random-fourier-features.md) | Random Fourier Features, from scratch | Bochner's theorem → `src/pro/math/rff.ts`, measured two-spirals worked example, RFF vs Nyström |

## Conventions

- **Numbering**: zero-padded, monotonic across both folders so an ADR and its plan share a number (`ADR-0001` ↔ `IMPL-0001`).
- **Status fields** on ADRs: `Proposed` → `Accepted` → `Implemented` → optionally `Superseded by ADR-NNNN`.
- **Plans** are living documents until the work ships; they get archived (not deleted) when the linked ADR moves to `Implemented`.
- **Don't edit accepted ADRs in place** — supersede them with a new ADR. The history matters.

## When to add a new ADR

You're proposing a change that:
- Removes or renames part of the public API.
- Changes how a major subsystem works.
- Establishes a project-wide convention (testing, docs, lesson format, etc.).
- Has a non-obvious tradeoff someone might second-guess in six months.

Tiny refactors and bug fixes don't need ADRs.
